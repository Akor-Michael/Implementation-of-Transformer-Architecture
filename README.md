## Introduction

The Transformer model is a groundbreaking architecture for various natural language processing tasks. It utilizes self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual information efficiently, making it suitable for tasks such as machine translation and text generation.

## Usage

### Positional Encoding

The `PositionalEncoding` class in the code provides positional encodings for the input sequences. Positional encodings are essential for the Transformer model to understand the order of words in a sequence.

### Self-Attention

The `SelfAttention` class implements self-attention mechanisms. It calculates attention scores between different positions in the input sequence and applies masking if needed.

### Multi-Head Attention

The `MultiHeadAttention` class extends self-attention to multiple heads, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.

### Feedforward Network

The `FeedForward` class implements a feedforward network with ReLU activation for non-linearity.

### Transformer Block

The `TransformerBlock` class represents a single transformer block that combines multi-head self-attention, layer normalization, feedforward network, and dropout layers.

### Encoder

The `Encoder` class comprises multiple stacked transformer blocks and handles the encoding of input sequences.

### Decoder Block

The `DecoderBlock` class represents a single decoder block that combines multi-head self-attention, layer normalization, feedforward network, and dropout layers for decoding sequences.

### Decoder

The `Decoder` class consists of stacks of decoder blocks and handles the decoding of sequences.

### Transformer Model

The `Transformer` class integrates the encoder and decoder to create the complete Transformer model.

### Training Loop

The provided code also includes a training loop example. It demonstrates how to train the Transformer model using a custom dataset, loss function, and optimizer.

## Custom Dataset

To use the code you would need a data folder with your own data to train the model on your specific tasks.
